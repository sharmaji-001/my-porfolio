            <h2>I am an enthusiastic and motivated DevOps engineer with a foundational understanding of both development and operations. Recently completing my degree in [MCA] from [G.D GOENKA UNIVERSITY], I have gained hands-on experience in key DevOps tools and practices through [ projects, or coursework].

I am proficient in version control systems like Git, and have worked with CI/CD pipelines using tools such as Jenkins and GitHub Actions. My experience with cloud platforms, particularly [AWS/Azure/GCP], has allowed me to understand how to deploy and manage applications in a scalable environment.

I am passionate about automating processes and improving collaboration between development and operations teams. I enjoy problem-solving and learning new technologies, and I’m eager to apply my skills in a professional setting to contribute to impactful projects.

In my free time, I engage with the tech community by contributing to open-source projects and staying updated with the latest trends in DevOps.</h2>
